# Automate the Boring Stuff
>This collection of solutions to the practice projects found in "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart will help you navigate through the book successfully. You can access the book online at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ or purchase it from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff or Amazon.

>The book is meant for people who are new to programming and want to learn how to write programs that can help with everyday tasks. Throughout the book, Al Sweigart gives you projects to practice with, and I completed almost all of them and put them online for you to see.

>It's worth noting that while my solutions work, there may be more efficent methods to achieve the similar results. I only used techniques or ideas from the book to keep things familiar for new programmers. Some of the chapters are outdated and the modules may have different syntax now, but I tried my best to point out any changes in the code. If you run into any issues with my code, let me know and I'll do my best to update it for compatibility newer versions.

>Furthermore, I've included comments to explain each block of code. Subscribe to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@jimfrvnklin) for more details on how the code works. I hope that putting everything together will make it easier for you.

>Finally, I'm not a professional programmer and so I apologize if there are any mistakes in my code. I did my best to follow the PEP 8 guidelines when writing it, and I welcome any comments or suggestions you may have.

>Remark:
>
>"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart was the first book I used when learning Python and I highly recommend it. Prior to starting my Python journey, I had worked on assignments and projects that required knowledge in Excel VBA, MatLab and C++. The book uses an IDE as its main source of writing code and I personally used Pycharm by JetBrains. VS Code by Microsoft is a good alternative you may opt in for. I highly suggest you use an IDE, especially if you are new to programming. It will help you prevent making mistakes as well as familiarizing yourself with the PEP 8 guidelines.
